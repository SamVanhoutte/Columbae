## Name
Named after the fast moving star [Mu Columbae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_Columbae), which is a Runaway star.
A runaway star is one that is moving through space with an abnormally high velocity relative to the surrounding interstellar medium. The proper motion of a runaway star often points exactly away from a stellar association, of which the star was formerly a member, before it was hurled out.
